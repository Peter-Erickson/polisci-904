Second, precedent: If China conducts deployments like this to the islands it has enlarged with runways in the Spratlys, it will violate Xi's pledge and introduce an air control capability that ratchets up the military stakes in an area of the South China Sea far from China's borders.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,73,114,2015,-0.3948053,0.10789162,0.4819841,0.14923144,-0.3344545,0.13675193,0.4806852,0.1625518,-0.077815789,0.2371386,0.042270916,0.2671994,-0.124840909,0.2519586,-0.053333333,0.2919643,37.48263,47.20725,84.4099
