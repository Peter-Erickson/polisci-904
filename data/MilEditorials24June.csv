"Alison, John",1,Distinguished Service,1979-07-27,WaPO,Air Force,M,8,,1,,,,,"Gen. John Lavelle may have made mistakes, but these were in the interest of saving American lives in a hopeless war in which Americans were constrained by arbitrary rules while fighting an enemy that knew no rules.",,,
"Taylor, Maxwell",1,SALT II: The Numbers Fallacy,1979-08-17,WaPO,Army,M,10,,,1,,,,"Thus, it is clear that US forces, to match Soviet destructive capabilities, would need a considerable superiority in numbers of weapons to compensate for these disadvantages…accordingly, paristy based on numbers alone is revealed as a dangerous fallacy, one which entails serious consequences. ",,,
"Turner, Stansfield",1,Why Stop at a Triad?,1981-09-15,NYT,Navy,M,10,,,1,,,,"The argument that the United States must preserve its triad of strategic nuclear forces is bogus. It is bogus because it only concerns what weapons we possess, not what they must achieve. The real issues are, what is the objective of the triad, and does it take  a mix of three strategic weapons systems to achieve it?",,,
"Turner, Stansfield",1,The Zero Option,1981-12-02,NYT,Navy,M,10,,,1,,,,"In sum, President Reagan's proposal has merit but also risk. For it to work, we must hold to it and press our advantage no matter how loudly the Soviet Union screams or our allies urge compromise. ",,,
"Taylor, Maxwell",1,Make the Arms Fit the Task,1983-07-18,WaPO,Army,M,10,,,1,,,,"Having long and openly lamented the absence of a rational military policy, I am occasionally asked what such a policy would be like and what it might be expected to accomplish. The purpose of this article is to answer these questions. The dominant characteristic of the policy I have in mind is task orientation - that is, it would specify the strategic tasks that the Armed Forces should be able to perform and cause these forces to be designed accordingly. ",,,
"Rowny, Edward",1,Groundwork for Arms Progress,1984-02-02,NYT,Army,M,9,,,1,,,,"In sum, there has been real progress to date. Both sides have responded, in varying degrees, to the other's concerns. And we have offered to explore trading areas of respective interest and advantages to narrow our differences.",,,
"Lemnitzer, Lyman",1,Retain the Joint Chiefs,1984-06-19,NYT,Army,M,10,,,1,,,,"The existing system is sound. It would be a serious error to adopt proposed legislative changes in the presently assigned functions, duties, and responsibilities of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",,,
"LaRocque, Gene",1,The Worrisome Prospect of an Invasion of Nicaragua,1984-11-23,NYT,Navy,M,7,1,,,,,,"President Reagan should take the long range view and not succumb to the lure of intervention, which would only add a new layer of violence and destruction to Central America. ",,,
"McFarlane, Robert",0,McFarlane on Why,1986-11-13,WaPO,Marine Corps,M,5,,,1,,,,"My point here is not to assert the China experience as a perfect analogue to recent efforts toward Iran. But the basic issue was the same. Nurturing a strategic reorientation in a country's policy requires discretion, judgement, and patience. And it is never risk free. ",,,
"Rowny, Edward",1,Build Up Regular Forces,1987-06-05,NYT,Army,M,9,,,1,,,,"In order to redress the imbalance of conventional forces, we must improve our own conventional force capabilities and work to eliminate the imbalance through negotiation. If we ""aim to parley,"" as Winston Churchill once advised, we could achieve both ends. ",,,
"McFarlane, Robert",0,Give Top Billing to Strategic Arms,1987-06-23,NYT,Marine Corps ,M,5,,,1,,,,The Russians read our headlines reporting Congressional misgivings over the defense budget. And while the Russians need a lot of Western help in the way of credits….surely we are not so naïve as to give them both the answers to their problems and cuts in our own defense budget without getting anything in return. ,,,
"Sick, Gary",1,Failure and Danger in the Gulf,1988-07-06,NYT,Navy,M,6,,,1,,,,"President Reagan has hurriedly proclaimed this incident [the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by Americans] ""closed."" True, the historical tape cannot be replayed. The dead cannot be brought back to life. But the need to examine the underlying policy assumptions and practices that led to this disaster is more urgent than ever before. ",,,
"Haig, Alexander",1,Haunted by a Vienna Summit Meeting,1988-12-05,NYT,Army,M,10,,,1,,,,"The new administrationhas heavy work to do before it can begin to talk about major deals with the Soviet Union…In short, it needs to hammer out an allied consensus on the full range of East-West issues.",,,
"Haig, Alexander",1,An Alliance for All Europe,1990-01-18,NYT,Army,M,10,,,1,,,,"But there is another historic blunder to avoid: Above all, we must not become an idvertent accomplice in a Soviet attempt to divert Eastern Europe's march to democracy into the dead end of reform Communism.",,,
"Haig, Alexander",1,Gulf Analogy: Munich or Vietnam?,1990-12-10,NYT,Army,M,10,,,1,,,,"International conflicts attract historical analogies the way honey attracts bears, because the ""lessons learned"" from such analogies are supposed to help us avoid past mistakes. The Persian Gulf Crisis is no exception, and two analogies in particular - Munich and Vietnam - might have something to tell us. ",,,
"Dickens, Samuel",1,Assassins in Manaqua,1991-04-16,NYT,Air Force,M,6,,,1,,,,"If their assassins are allowed to continue to act with impunity, no one is safe in Nicaraugua.",,,
"Odom, William",1,Picking and Choosing Among Emerging Dictatorships,1992-04-12,WaPO,Army,M,9,,,1,,,,"How should the West react to emerging dictators in these states?...In a word, if the West is faced with a series of emerging dictatorships, it needs to discriminate amongst them. A few might be the best hope for a future return to democracy. ",,,
"Odom, William",0,Who Really Won the Cold War? Credit Where Credit is Due,1992-08-19,WaPO,Army,M,9,,,1,,,,The post-Cold War challenge demands at least a modicum of bipartisanship. Half-truths about who won the Cold War will not forge the necessary consensus to use American influence to promote democracy and free markets around the world. ,,,
"Snider, Don",0,Stop Serbia. Bomb Serbia.,1992-10-13,NYT,Army,M,6,1,,,,,,"To keep the conflict from spreading, a coalition of democratic powers under the United Nations should use military force against Serbia, including a strategic air campaign, along with economic and political pressures. ",,,
"Kenney, George and Dugan, Michael",1,Operation Balkan Storm: Here's a Plan,1992-11-29,NYT,Air Force,M,10,1,,,,,,A win in the Balkans would establish US leadership in the pst-cold warworld in a way that Operation Desert Storm never could.,,,
"McFarlane, Robert",0,Consider What Star Wars Accomplished,1993-08-24,NYT,Marine Corps,M,5,,,1,,,,"But today the subject of ""Star Wars"" is raised not in the context of its strategic worth but rather for its potential for scandal - an interesting comment on our political and social values. Even allowing that the American contribution to the collapse of Marxism was elatively small, the role is no less striking. Anything that shortened  an ideological change of such immense consequences is worth serious study.",,,
"Odom, William",1,Yeltsin's Deal with the Devil,1993-10-24,WaPO,ARMY,M,9,,,1,,,,"Yeltsin [in closing Parliament] at last has a political coalition that can break the political paralysis in Moscow. At the same time, he is restoring political forces that will make economic and poitical reform difficult if not possible. ",,,
"Zumwalt, Elmo",1,The War is Over,1994-02-07,NYT,Navy,M,10,,1,,,,,"As a parent and a wartime commander, I know the anguish these families feel. They need to know what happened to their loves ones, or at least that all that can be done has been done. This can only happen if we put aside bitterness and revenge, lift the trade sanctions, recognize the government and begin the peaceful penetration of Vietnam.",,,
"Odom, William",1,"Invade, Don't Bomb",1994-02-18,WSJ,Army,M,9,1,,,,,,"Assuming that air strikes alone won't achieve any significant results on the ground in Bosnia, they could still have one redeeming consequence: waking the administration up to the necessity of designing and implementing an effective NATO strategy for Europe. That is probably too much to hope for, but not many other straws are there to grasp.",,,
"Trainor, Bernard",1,Gorazde Cease-Fire is Irrelevant,1994-04-27,NYT,Marine Corps,M,9,1,,,,,,"While the US and Russia pledged yesterday to strive for a diplomatic solution to the war, that solution must recognize the Serbs' supremacy on the battlefield. Spreading the protective wing of NATO airpower over the Muslim enclaves has ended the slaughter at Gorazde, as it did at Sarajevo. But the move is strategically and militarily irrelevant. ",,,
"Watts, Claudius",1,Single-Sex Education Benefits Men Too,1994-05-03,WSJ,Air Force,M,9,,,,1,,,"But the Citadel is not fighting to keep women out of the Corps of Cadets because there is a grandiose level of 19th-centru machismo to protect. Rather, we at the Citadel are trying to preserve an educational environment that molds young men into grown men of good character, honor, and integrity. It is part of a single-sex educational system that has proven itself successful throughout history.",,,
"Odom, William",1,The Ames Case: A Symptom of Crisis,1994-07-15,WaPO,Army,M,9,,1,,,,,The intelligence communiy is in its greatest postwar crisis…At least four major factors are involved…,,,
"Joyce, Larry",1,Remember the Losses - and Lessons - Of Somalia,1994-10-03,WSJ,Army,M,5,,1,,,,,"When American Troops are in a combat environment, they become the number one priority. Domestic agendas should be put on the back burner until the Troops are out of the line of fire. The President must constantly stay abreast of the military situation to ensure that military actions are consistent with current foreign policy.",,,
"Sweeney, Charles ",1,The Sky Was Bleached a Bright White,1995-07-19,WSJ,Air Force,M,8,,1,,,,,"I believed then and continue to believe today that President Truman made the right decision to dropthe bomb. As the father of 10 children and the grandfather of 21, I am certainly grateful that the war ended when it did. ",,,
"Odom, William",1,One Year? In Bosnia?,1995-12-05,NYT,Army,M,9,1,,,,,,"The very idea of creating a stable Bosnia in one year is ludicrous…many Americans want to support the deployment, but the President makes it extremely difficult with his mission-strategy mismatch. ",,,
"Haig, Alexander",1,Custom's Union: Time to Recognize Turkey's Friendship,1995-12-12,WSJ,Army,M,10,,,1,,,,A decision to bring Turkey into the Customs Union will help preserve Europe and improve it. ,,,
"Odom, William and Reddaway, Peter",0,Yeltsin's False Truce,1996-04-03,NYT,Army,M,9,,,1,,,,"Russia's integrity as a democracy can probably be shored up only by letting Chechnya go. If the Clinton administration refuses to use its financial leverage to make Mr. Yeltsin realize this, then it at least owed the American public a clear explanation of how our implicit support of his grim war is helping achieve American interests. ",,,
"Evans, David",1,The Navy's Blues,1996-06-08,NYT,Marine Corps,M,5,,,1,,,,"""Adrift"" is the word most associated with the Navy these days, an image the newly appointed Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Jay L. Johnson, must work to dispel.",,,
"Odom, William",1,Russia's Military: Down But Not Out,1996-08-27,WSJ,Army,M,9,,,1,,,,"Even if liberal political leaders prevail in Moscow, they will continue trying to increase Russian influence in Central Europe. The key point is that the political stalemate in Moscow has not sidelined Russia from this competition. It would be a serious error to conclude on the basis of its failure in Chechnya that the Russian military won't be able to back Moscow's diplomacy. Indeed, the Chechen debacle could have just the opposite effect--spurring the very reforms that have thus far eluded the Russian military.",,,
"Odom, William",1,"Chechnya, Freedom, and the Voice of Yeltsin Past",1996-08-28,WaPO,Army,M,9,,,,,,1,"Is Clinton oblivious to his moral complicity with Yeltsinin more than 30,000 deaths in Chechnya, including several thousand Russian civilians? How can he, at the same time, take seriously Moscow's complaint's about violations of the ""human rights"" of Russians living in Estonia?",,,
"Zumwalt, E.R.",1,A Needless Risk for US Troops,1997-01-06,WaPo,Navy,M,10,,,1,,,,"If we refuse to ratify, some governments will use our refusal as an excuse to keep their chemical weapons…At the bottom line, our failure to ratify will substantially increase the risk of a chemical attack against American service personnel. ",,,
"Butler, George Lee",1,The General's Bombshell: What Happened When I Called for Phasing Out the US Nuclear Arsenal,1997-01-12,WaPo,Air Force,M,10,,,1,,,,…surely we still comprehend that to threaten the deaths of tens of hundreds of millions of people presages an atrocity beyond anything in the record of mankind?...This cannot be the moral legacy of the Cold War. And it is our responsibility to ensure that it will not be.,,,
"Rowny, Edward",1,Yes to the Chemical Weapons Accord,1997-04-23,WaPo,Army,M,9,,,1,,,,The Chemical Weapons Convention now up for vote is in the US national interest and should be ratified…I urge the U.S. Senate to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention.,,,
"Odom, William",1,A look at Expanding Nato; History Tells Us the Alliance Should Grow,1997-07-06,WaPo,Army,M,9,,,1,,,,"No great strategic departure is without risks, and enlarging NATO has some…likewise, there are risks in not going forward, for that too is a strategic departure - backward from Europe.",,,
"Gard, Robert",1,Flawed Arguments for Landmines,1997-07-16,WaPo,Army,M,9,,,1,,,,"In their July 9 op-ed article, ""Hard Questions About Landmines,"" a National Defense University official and an Army colonel argued that efforts to ban future deployments of…mines are ""more nostrums than solutions.""…I strongly disagree.",,,
"Larson, Doyle",1,Plenty of Room to Honor the Air Force,1997-09-21,WaPo,Air Force,M,8,,1,,,,,The attack on the Air Force Memorial…was off-base. The Air Force Memorial would not intrude on the Iwo Jima memorial.,,,
"McFarlane, Robert",0,Pakistan's Catch-22,1998-05-30,NYT,Marine Corps ,M,5,,,1,,,,"…We must out forward and lead a serious agenda of arms control. Separate, but related, is the enduring need to assure the security of the weakest member in the region, Pakistan…",,,

"Odom, William",1,"Our Russian Illusions, Crushed by Reality",1998-09-06,WaPo,Army,M,9,,,1,,,,"We must shift away from our obsession with creating a democracy in Russia and put our emphasis on creating a liberal political system - that is, a system that limits the state's power and that guarantees citizens' private property and civil rights.",,,
"Sullivan, Gordon",1,Washington Tightwads are Creating a Hollow Military,1998-09-22,WSJ,Army,M,10,,,1,,,,Defense Spending has fallen too far.,,,

Anything that causes our friends to be reluctant to share intelligence with us could severely damage our national security.",,,
"Peters, Ralph",1,A Question of Leadership,1998-12-17,WSJ,Army,M,5,1,,,,,,"And I hope that Mr. Clinton, as he sends those who are truly our nation's finest into combat, has a strategic plan and the guts to see the plan through. When our nation employs its military power, it must do so resolutely, with clarity of intent and perseverance. ",,,
"Bacevich, Andrew",0,Discord Still: Clinton and the Military,1999-01-03,WaPo,Army,M,6,,,1,,,,"Thus, the price of civil-military harmony is a defective policy that wastes resources, alienates allies and undermines American credibillity abroad. That, rather than soldiers' low opinions of the president's character, should be cause for concern. ",,,
"Peters, Ralph",1,"America Must Stop Kosovo's Killers, Not Baby-Sit Them",1999-02-23,WSJ,Army,M,5,1,,,,,,"The gunmen have to go…their weapons must be removed, not just buried or stacked in local armories…If America is not willing to do what is necessary in Kosovo --- disarming, arresting, and enforcing --- Washington's efforts will be no more than another time-out call between bouts of slaughter.

"Odom, William",1,A Conditional Surrender,1999-06-06,NYT,Army,M,9,,,1,,,,Are we witnessing a diplomatic victory that will bring peace to the Balkans? Or will President Clinton win the Neville Chamberlain memorial umbrella trophy for accepting a phony peace? Let us hope for the former - although much evidence suggests the latter will come to pass. ,,,
"Peters, Ralph",1,Peace in Kosovo: And the Peace May Be Even More So,1999-06-07,WSJ,Army,M,5,1,,,,,,"A true NATO victory [in the Balkans] would have seen an independent Kosovo, the punishment of war crimnals and a change of regime in Belgrade. ",,,
"McCaffrey, Barry",0,Don't Legalize Those Drugs,1999-06-29,WaPo,Army,M,10,,,,,1,,"Drug consumption damages the brain, which in turn produces other forms of destructive behavior.

"Peters, Ralph",1,Empires' End in East Timor - and Beyond,1999-09-09,WSJ,Army,M,5,,,1,,,,"What is to be done?...First, Washington must take a long term view of global change…Second, the US must align itself with forces of popular change, abandoning its reflexive commitment to the forces of reaction.

"McFarlane, Robert ",0,The Uses of a Coup,1999-10-14,NYT,Marine Corps,M,5,,,1,,,,"The world has a huge stake in restraining the cetrifugal forces at play in both India and Pakistan.

",,,
"Odom, William",1,Clinton's Quids Don't Produce Russian Quos,1999-11-22,WSJ,Army,M,9,,,,,,1,"Russia simply is not on the path to liberal democracy or to an effective market economy. Periodic assertions that the Russian economy is ""on the mend"" or that ""progress toward democracy"" may be slow but is continuing, or that ""polarized politics"" is a thing of the past are simply misleading. Mr. Clinton needs to ask his Russia experts some tough questions.",,,
"Stockdale, James",1,John McCain in the Crucible,1999-11-26,NYT,Navy,M,9,,1,,,,,…I think John McCain is solid as a rock. And I consider it blasphemy to smudge the straight-arrow prisoner of war record of a man who was near death when he arrived in Hoa Loa Prison in 1967…,,,
